> Small game demos built with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) and [Mono C#](https://www.mono-project.com/).

### 🏠 [Homepage](https://github.com/imprevo/godot-demos)

<!-- ### ✨ [Demo](TODO) -->

## Motivation

I've learned a lot of gamedev fundamentals while working with [Phaser 3](https://github.com/imprevo/mini-games): game loop, life cycles, positioning, I/O, physics, etc. I've implemented some build-in Phaser features to better understand the engine.

I realized that I should integrate different tools on my own to create advanced games. It's very interesting! But unfortunately I have a very limited time for that.  I want to focus more on programming, game mechanics and high level tools. That's why I made a decision to switch to something else.

### So, why [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)?

- Cool getting started guide with memes 🤡 *No, really, I like it!*
- It's an open source and crossplatform game engine
- Includes many useful tools for visual editing
- I can use C# which is very close to Typescript that I know well
- Supports 2D and 3D game development
- Supports builds for multiple environments, not just web
- Supports plugins for editor

It's great but not perfect. I've already notice a couple of issues:

- Build for web is very huge - 25MB for empty project 😱
- No official support for consoles 🎮

### Why not [Unity](https://unity.com/)?

I tried it but I couldn't compile the default project for web from linux 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♂️

## Prerequisites
